    <h1>Welcome</h1>
    <p>
        Welcome to the Art of Computer Programming. I am Per Lundholm and ArtComputer is my company. I am a member
        of Crisp, a world known brand within agile development. I have been doing this for over 35 years and here is
        what I
        have come to believe on the subject of programming.
    </p>
    <p>
        I will speak about craftsmanship, architecture and people. I will speak about Readability, Refactoring,
        Retrospectives, Resources, Responsibility, Respect.
    </p>
    <h2>Craftsmanship</h2>
    <p>
        Programming is a craft. We do not create the same piece of software over and over again. Each time we solve a
        new
        problem. We like to look at well crafted code but we have different opinions on what "well crafted" means.
    </p>
    <p>
        The first thing about craftsmanship is <b>refactoring</b>. Code is never well written on first attempt.
        We simply can not just sit down and type well crafted code from scratch. If we could, we would not be solving
        anything complicated. Instead, we learn about the problem as we go. Therefore, to created well crafted code,
        you need to refactor it. You can not simply stop because you finally got it working.
    </p>
    <h3>Refactoring</h3>
    <p>
        When you refactor, you change the code without changing its behaviour. To guarantee that, you need to have tests
        that will tell you when your changes break the code. Tests shall also be well crafted, of course. Serving as a
        specification, they should not be coupled to the implementation.
    </p>
    <p>
        When your code pass the tests, you can start looking at <b>readability</b>. Never be proud of being able to read
        cryptic code, be proud of writing code that reads like running water. I have written <a
            href="https://blog.crisp.se/2015/03/05/perlundholm/7-rules-on-code-readability">7 rules on
        code readability</a> which you may enjoy but there are more sources out there. What is important is your
        attitude,
        never stop until your code is readable.
